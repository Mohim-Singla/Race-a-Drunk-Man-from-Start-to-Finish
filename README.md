# Race-a-Drunk-Man-from-Start-to-Finish

This is an interactive console animation program, where your choice of character (any letter/digit), starting from center, will appear to move funnily between Danger Zone and the Winning Zone.


If he/she
1. Croses the "Winning line" within the specified time limit (in our case, 5000), then the person wins the game and is being awarded a score.
2. Enters the "Danger Zone" within the specified time limit (in our case, 5000), then the person loses the game and is being awarded 00 score.
3. Keeps dangling between thw "Winning and Danger Zones" and time's over then "Times-up!!!" message would be printed and would be given a random score(between 0 to 1000).

A warning message is also given at half time period (in our case, at 2500).
